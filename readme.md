# General

The goal of this project is to support real time simulation of celestial mechanics, at first using Newtonian equations of motion. This project came out of an idea I had for building a text-rpg-like space battle game that is played in real time and makes the player base their strategy on things like

* position of objects in the system (planets, asteroids),
* amount of fuel, ammo,
* ship damage,
* gravitational effects of large objects (stars, planets, etc.).

# Structure

Rather than tackle the n-body problem, I think I will start by building good support for general two-body problem situations, mostly involving one mass that is much larger than the other. This simplifies the calculation of orbits of many planets and ships around a single comparatively massive star. Eventually I do plan on calculating orbital perturbation as small ships pass through the gravitational field of larger objects like planets or moons.

My plan is to build a physics engine that will handle all the math for each two-body problem. The game client will pass parameters to the engine for a two-body problem that needs solving, and the engine will spit out the answer. I think that separation will simplify building clients.

# Progress

I am able to define orbits in terms of five elements: [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination), [longitude of the ascending node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_ascending_node), [argument of periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_periapsis), [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity), and [semimajor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis). Then, given those initial conditions, I can find the point in 3d space of a body at an arbitrary point in time through some math. Here is a plot of three orbits I generated using this code.

I wrote the beginnings of an interface for the game. This involved a bunch of work with curses, a C library for handling term cap and drawing optimizations. At first I was using the :cl-ncurses Common Lisp library, but I ran into some problems. I found a 'curses.lisp' file written by Timofei Shatrov (https://common-lisp.net/project/lifp/uwar.htm), and have been using my own extended version of that to do graphics. The only thing you can do in the game right now is query a database of information about different bodies in the system, like planets. The progress up to this point has mostly been behind-the-scenes type things, like making infrastructure for doing curses graphics. So I think progress be more visible from now on.

Here is a picture of the current interface.

And here is a screenshot of the result of some curses code plotting points on an elliptical orbit around a mass at the origin.

# Running

I have been using a hack to run my game program. The file 'newcore.lisp' will, when passed a filename as a command line argument, compile a new sbcl core file that includes the libraries necessary for this project. The file 'main.lisp' has the shebang that uses this new file to execute. I am doing this because I am using quicklisp to load dependencies, and once I get around to actually installing them the run process will be cleaner.
