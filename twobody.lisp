; for variables that require solving, as opposed to just
; grabbing them from a getter, we need access to the
; expressions that solve them. We also need access to a
; precedence hierarchy that says which terms need to be
; solved before another.
;
; Example: In order to solve r through
;
;               p
;       r = ---------,
;           1 + ecosf
;
; we need to solve f, which can be done so given the orbit
; and the time.
;
; This sounds like it could be done recursively. Like for
; each term that needs solving, store the expression,
; along with a pointer to any other terms that need
; solving before it.

; Let's say we encounter the symbol f used in a function body.
; This means we need to make a let block that binds the correct
; value to f. How do we solve for f? We call the function
; 'get-true-anomaly', passing in the orbit and the time, both
; of which are readily available. Assuming we are using a hash
; table to go from symbol to expression, we might store 'f' in
; this way
;
;       (defvar *expr-db* (make-hash-table))
;       (setf (gethash 'f *expr-db*) '(get-true-anomaly orbit time))
;
; so that a call to (gethash 'f *expr-db*) will return
; '(get-true-anomaly orbit time). This should work in situations
; like that of (spatial-orientation), where if we change our
; body from

;       (defun spatial-orientation (orbit time)
;         (let ((f (get-true-anomaly orbit time)))
;           (values-list (get-3d-coords orbit (solve-r orbit f) f))))
;
; to
;
;       (orbitfn spatial-orientation (orbit time)
;         (values-list (get-3d-coords orbit (solve-r orbit f) f))),
;
; macro-expansion will result in the following definition:
;
;       (defun spatial-orientation (orbit time)
;         (let ((f (get-true-anomaly orbit time)))
;           (values-list (get-3d-coords (solve-r orbit f) f)))).
;
; This expansion correctly binds the symbol f, which we know
; because the expansion is identical to our previous definition.
;
; What we really want (spatial-orientation) to look like, however,
; is this
;
;       (orbitfn spatial-orientation (orbit time)
;         (values-list (get-3d-coords r f))).
;
; This last step requires the correct binding of the symbol r to
; the radius of the given orbit at the given time. This value can
; be easily solved given the orbit and the true anomaly, f, so we
; might store 'r in our *expr-db* like so
;
;       (setf (gethash 'r *expr-db*) '(solve-r orbit f)).
;
; We have to be careful, though, about the order in which these
; symbols are bound in the macro-expansion. Since f can be solved
; directly from the orbit and the time, we bind that first. Then
; we have everything we need to bind r to the correct radius. So, we
; want our final macroexpansion to look like this
;
;       (defun spatial-orientation (orbit time)
;         (let* ((f (get-true-anomaly orbit time))
;                (r (solve-r orbit f)))
;               (values-list (get-3d-coords r f)))).
;
; Notice the 'let' in the previous expansions has been changed
; to 'let*.' This is because we need the value of f available
; to calculate the value of r.
;
; How are we going to ensure our variables in the let block are
; bound in the right order? Well, we can look at the definition
; of orbitfn to see that the bindings are just added to a list
; in the order in which they appear in the result of (symbols-used).
; If we can control the order of the list that gets used in the
; loop, we can control which variables get bound when.
;
; We've reduced our problem to a sorting problem: sort the results
; of (symbols-used) by a predefined precedence. All that's left
; to do is define the precedence. Since we already have a hash
; table that stores variables as keys, we can extend the
; corresponding values to store information about the variable's
; precedence. If we say that lower numbers give higher precedence,
; we might change the way we store 'f to this
;
;       (setf (gethash 'f *expr-db*) (list '(get-true-anomaly orbit time) 1)),
;
; and the way we store 'r to this
;
;       (setf (gethash 'r *expr-db*) (list '(solve-r orbit f) 2)),
;
; since we need to ensure 'r comes after, and thus is bound after, 'f.
; The built-in (sort) is able to take an arbitrary predicate
; function of two arguments that returns true iff the first argument
; is "less than" the second. In our case, "less than" means
; "has a higher precedence." So we can define a predicate function
; that will do what we want like this
;
;       (defun binding-pred (x y)
;         (< (cadr (gethash x *expr-db*))
;            (cadr (gethash y *expr-db*)))).
;
; This code brings up a tangential issue: that we should write
; getters for the values stored in the *expr-db* hash table. So
; we will, and they are as follows
;
;       (defun get-precedence (x)
;         (cadr (gethash x *expr-db*)))
;
;       (defun get-expr (x)
;         (car (gethash x *expr-db*))).
;
; Now we can write our predicate function like this
;
;       (defun binding-pred (x y)
;         (< (get-precedence x)
;            (get-precedence y))),
;
; which in my opinion is nicer.
;
; This method of going from symbol to expression can be generalized
; to variables that don't need solving. We can store the 'ecc in
; our *expr-db* like this
;
;       (setf (gethash 'ecc *expr-db*) '(get-ecc orbit))
;
; and it will expand to the same binding as it was before. This also
; removes the need for that bad interning hack I was using.
;
; Our new orbitfn macro can be written like this
;
;       (defmacro orbitfn (name args body)
;         (let ((symbs (sort #'binding-pred
;                            (symbols-used *orbitsymbs* body))))
